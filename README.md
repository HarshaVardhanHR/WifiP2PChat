# WifiP2PChat
<body>
 It is a simple Wifi P2p based chat application implemented using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/wifip2p#create-application">Wifi Direct P2p API</a> in android.
 It is very much helpful in places where there is no internet connection. In those places we can connect with another person using this app via Wifi Direct. We can chat, send files,
 videos, images, recordings and drawings etc.
